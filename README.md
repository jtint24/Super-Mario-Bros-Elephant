# Super Mario Bros. Elephant

A hack of the original Super Mario Bros. with the elephant apple from the upcoming SMB Wonder added. 

Based on the decompilation/C++ transliteration made by [Mitchell Sternke](https://github.com/MitchellSternke).

To run, navigate to `build` and run `run.sh`. This requires moving a reference NES rom file, if this fails, simply place it (the file tilted "SMB_Elephant_Sprites.nes") in your home directory.
